# SearchEngine
Search engine made in python using OOP concepts.
This program uses tree data structures to implement a mini local search engine. In the project there are 18 text files, each describing a specific data structure.
The purpose of this program is to return text files with highest appearance/most prominent occurence of a given query after parsing the keywords of each file.
This program is mainly driven by the AVL Tree data structure.
This works like common search engines, as it returns the most relevant files to the query given.
Search results can be limited to top x results (where x is a set bound of files to be returned).
If no limit is set, every file relevant to the given query will be returned.
